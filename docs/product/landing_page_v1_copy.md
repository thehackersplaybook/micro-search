## **About the Founders.**

**Aditya Patange**
Founder & Architect, Microsearch.io

> ‚ÄúI created Microsearch because search is the nervous system of our digital world. My goal is to build tools that let everyone‚Äîengineers, researchers, creators‚Äîfind and build on knowledge, at the speed of thought. To be honest, my mindfulness practise auto-built microsearch in my mind's software, and I just wanted to make it a physical reality.‚Äù

## **Design Notes / Suggestions**

- **Primary Palette:**
  Black background, white text. Use a single bold accent (suggest **electric blue** `#0070f3` for links, buttons, and highlights‚Äîclean, professional, modern hacker energy).
- **Fonts:**
  Use a monospace font for headings/subheads (e.g., IBM Plex Mono or JetBrains Mono), with a modern sans-serif (e.g., Inter, Roboto) for body text.
- **Animations:**
  Subtle fade-ins on section load, underline slide-in on nav hover, micro-interactions on buttons (scale/tint on hover).
  Loading dots or matrix-style blink for the ‚ÄúTry Now‚Äù search box, but keep it tasteful.

**NOTE**: Ensure all sentences have full-stops at the end just like this document, including headers and subtitles.
